#PROBLEM STATEMENT
Wine quality is generally evaluated by domain experts but that is very costly,inconsistent so, it is better to use machine learning algorithms.
our goal is to predict wine quality.



#DATA_SET
red_wine and white_wine two data sets
column space/features/dimensions
1.fixed_acidity:it is a non-volatile which implies doesnot evapourate and gives sourness to wine.
2.volatile_acidity:acids that evapourate mainly acetic acid.
3.citric_acid:a organic acid found in small amounts which adds freshness to wine.
4.residual_sugar:sugar remaining after fermentation.which decides dry wine or sweet wine.
5.chlorides:amount of salts .
6.free_sulfur_dioxide:free so2 which prevents bacteria and oxidation.
7.total_sulfur_dioxide:free so2+bound s02.
8.density:mass per unit volume of wine.
9.ph:measures acidity/alkalinity of wine.
10.sulphates:acts as antimicrobial and enhances flavor intensity.
11.alcohol:alcohol percentage in wine.
12.quality:target coulmn/output variable.
